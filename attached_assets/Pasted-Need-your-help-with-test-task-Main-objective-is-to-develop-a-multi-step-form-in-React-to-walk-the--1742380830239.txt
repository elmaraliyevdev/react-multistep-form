Need your help with test task:

Main objective is to develop a multi-step form in React to walk the users through “Regulatory Information Set (RIS) submission”. Find below a set of requirements that cover the overall objective of the exercise:

The Regulatory Information Set (RIS) submission requires the user to go through 3 steps (3 screens).

Step 1: “Create a new number” page (/new-number)

1. Page Title & Context
    Heading: “Create a new number”
    Subtitle/Context text: “Choose a location and a number type”

2. Form Fields
    Country Selector (e.g., a SelectInput with “Germany (+49)” and other countries - Netherlands, France, Belgium, Austria).
    Number Type (Local, National, Mobile, etc.).

3. Next Step Button
    Disabled until valid inputs are selected.
    On click, navigate to the next step (/new-number/identity-type or programmatic route push).

4. Validation
    Country is required.
    Number type is required.

Step 2: “Select your identity type” page (/new-number/identity-type)

1. Page Title & Context
   Heading: “Select your identity type”
   Subtitle: “Information will be used to purchase and register the number on your behalf”

2. Identity Type Options
    Radio buttons or cards for “Business” vs. “Individual”
    Possibly an explanation text for each type.

3. Next Step Button
    Disabled until one option is selected.
    On click, navigate to the next step (/new-number/ris-form).

4. Validation
    Identity type selection is required.

Step 3: “Complete the RIS” page (/new-number/ris-form)

1. Page Title & Context
   Heading: “Complete the RIS”
   Subtitle: “Please upload the necessary documents.”

2. Form Sections
    Company Details (if “Business” was selected):
    - Company Name (required)
    - Company Registration Number (required)
    Company Address:
    - Country (required)
    - City (required)
    - ZIP/Postal Code (required)
    - Street Name (required)
    - Street Number (required)
    Proof of Address (required):
    - Document Type (dropdown: “Utility Bill, “Bank Statement”, Other”)
    - File Upload (drag-and-drop or input)



Notes:

Keep it simple! Need to use react-hook-form, zustand, and flowbite + tailwind for easier evaluation.
